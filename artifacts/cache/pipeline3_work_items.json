It is mostly just math and making sure the machines are turned on correctly.\nexample_answer_good: To scale up, I first ensure that all parameters like temperature, pH, and oxygen transfer are characterized at the bench scale. I would then use scaling factors, such as constant power per volume, to predict settings for the larger vessel. Next, I would perform a pilot run to identify any deviations in yield or growth patterns. Finally, I would document all findings to refine the operating procedures for the full-scale production run.\nexample_answer_mid: Scaling up involves moving things from small containers to big ones. You have to make sure the temperature stays the same and that the organisms have enough food.

Then, I would communicate with both stakeholders, explaining the situation transparently. I would ask them to help me understand the relative priority of each task. If both are critical, I would escalate the conflict to my direct supervisor to seek guidance on which one to prioritize and see if I can get support.\nexample_answer_mid: I would try my best to work as fast as possible to get both tasks done.

To bridge this, I suggested we use a shared digital board to track our tasks. I created the initial structure, but left space for them to add ideas freely. By combining my organization with their creativity, we stayed on schedule and produced a high-quality result that neither of us could have done alone.\nexample_answer_mid: I once worked with someone who didn't plan as much as I did.

It was better than trying to change how they worked or arguing about it.\nexample_answer_good: In my previous internship, I worked with a teammate who preferred working independently until the final deadline, while I preferred regular check-ins. I initiated a conversation to discuss our styles and we compromised by setting three specific milestone meetings. This approach allowed us both to feel comfortable, ensured the project remained on track, and we delivered the final report two days early.\nexample_answer_mid: I once had a partner on a project who didn't like to talk as much as I did. It was a bit difficult at first because I wasn't sure what they were doing. Eventually, we just focused on our own parts and put it together at the end.
