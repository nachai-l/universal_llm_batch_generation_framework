If someone disagrees with me, I usually just let them do it their way so there isn't any drama in the team.\nexample_answer_good: During a group project, a teammate and I disagreed on the best way to clean our dataset. I listened to their reasoning for using a specific method, then I shared my perspective on why a different approach might be safer for our goals. We decided to test both on a small subset of the data, compared the results together, and agreed on a hybrid solution that improved our final accuracy. This taught me to value different perspectives and use data to settle opinions.\nexample_answer_mid: I once worked with someone who didn't agree with my approach to a task.

If there are outliers, I just leave them in because all data is important.\nexample_answer_good: I start by visualizing the data distributions using histograms or box plots to identify outliers. For missing values, I check if they are missing at random. If only a small percentage is missing, I might use mean or median imputation, but if the missingness is significant, I investigate why before deciding to drop rows or use more complex filling methods. For outliers, I check if they are entry errors or genuine data points; if they are errors, I correct or remove them to prevent skewing the results.\nexample_answer_mid: I usually look for any empty cells in the spreadsheet and fill them with the average of the column.

I then work backward to list all the necessary components, such as data setup, logic implementation, and validation. I group these into tasks that shouldn't take more than four to six hours each. For example, if I'm building a new interface, I'll separate the layout work from the data integration.

I trust my intuition to know which steps are actually necessary and which ones are just there for bureaucracy.\nexample_answer_good: Even when things are moving fast, I never skip the mandated checklist. I treat the protocol as a non-negotiable part of the task rather than an extra step. If I feel rushed, I take a five-second 'tactical pause' to re-read the safety requirements. This ensures that speed never comes at the expense of quality or the safety of the project.\nexample_answer_mid: I try to memorize the protocols so I don't have to look them up every time.

If someone is difficult, I just ignore them and focus on what I need to do so the project doesn't get delayed. I don't like drama at work.\nexample_answer_good: In a previous project, a teammate and I disagreed on how to organize our shared tasks. I suggested we sit down and listen to each other's reasoning.

This approach allowed us to complete the project two days early with a high grade, teaching me how to adapt my communication to suit different preferences.\nexample_answer_mid: I once worked with a person who didn't like to talk much.

During a project meeting, we disagreed on a feature placement. I scheduled a quick one-on-one to understand his technical constraints. By listening first, I realized he was worried about load times. We reached a compromise that maintained the user experience without compromising performance, which improved our working relationship for the rest of the project.\nexample_answer_mid: I once worked with someone who was much more quiet than I was.

In the next review, the lead noted a significant improvement, and I now use a checklist to verify hierarchy before every submission.\nexample_answer_mid: My lead told me that I needed to change the way I was presenting my work because it was confusing.

I don't really use style guides because they can be too restrictive for new ideas.\nexample_answer_good: To maintain consistency, I always keep the project's design system or style guide open on my second monitor. Before I create a new element, I search the library to see if a component already exists. If I must create something new, I use the established color palette and typography scales. At the end of the day, I perform a 'visual audit' by comparing my new screens side-by-side with existing ones to ensure the padding and margins match perfectly.\nexample_answer_mid: I try to use the same colors and fonts that the rest of the project uses.

I realized this was a gap, so I spent three evenings watching tutorials and practicing with the prototyping software. I managed to build a functional model that allowed our team to conduct user testing, which ultimately led to a better final product. Now, I always set aside time each week to explore new features in our team's toolkit.\nexample_answer_mid: I noticed our team started using a new project management tool that I didn't know.
