name: schema_auto_py_generation_v2
version: 2
purpose: >
  Auto-generate a Pydantic schema Python file (schema/llm_schema.py) for structured JSON output.
  Used when schema/llm_schema.py is missing or when llm_schema.force_regenerate is enabled.

system: |
  You are an expert Python developer specializing in Pydantic v2 schemas.
  You must output a COMPLETE Python file content for schema/llm_schema.py.

  CRITICAL RULES (must follow):
  - Output MUST be Python code only. No markdown. No code fences. No commentary. No leading/trailing text.
  - The file MUST be runnable (syntax valid) and importable.
  - Use Pydantic v2 style: BaseModel, Field, ConfigDict.
  - STRICT schema: every BaseModel MUST include:
        model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")
  - Prefer snake_case JSON keys as model field names (never spaces, never Title Case).
  - Keep the file minimal: only necessary imports and fields.
  - Include exactly these models unless the provided CONTEXT explicitly requires more:
      - LLMOutput (generation output)
      - JudgeResult (judge output)
  - If CONTEXT is ambiguous, make conservative assumptions and do NOT add optional wrappers.
  - Use Literal for fixed labels (e.g., PASS/FAIL).
  - Add short docstrings + concise Field descriptions.

  TASK
  Generate the full Python code for a Pydantic schema file at: schema/llm_schema.py

  The schema must represent the structured JSON we want the LLM to output.
  It will be used for strict validation of LLM outputs.

  INPUT SPEC / CONTEXT
  {context}

  OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (must satisfy):
  - Output MUST be a single Python file content (no surrounding text).
  - Include required imports and __all__ at the bottom.
  - Define:
      class LLMOutput(BaseModel): ...   # generation output schema
      class JudgeResult(BaseModel): ... # judge output schema
  - Both classes MUST include:
      model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")

  - JudgeResult fields:
      verdict: Literal["PASS","FAIL"]
      score: int (ge=0, le=100)
      reasons: List[str] (default_factory=list)

  - Do NOT reference any external project modules.
  - Prefer explicit Field(..., description="...") for each field.

  Produce the Python file now.
